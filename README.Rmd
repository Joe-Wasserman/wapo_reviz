This is a quick re-visualization of a much-maligned plot from [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/16/party-divide-vaccination/) using Kaiser Family Foundation polling data.

```{r}
dat <- tribble(
  ~Population,              ~PoliticalOrientation,              ~Percent,
  "Total population",       "Democrats/leaning independents",   43,
  "Total population",       "Republicans/leaning independents", 41,
  "Unvaccinated (October)", "Democrats/leaning independents",   17,
  "Unvaccinated (October)", "Republicans/leaning independents", 60,
  "Unvaccinated (April)",   "Democrats/leaning independents",   36,
  "Unvaccinated (April)",   "Republicans/leaning independents", 42
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    PercentLabel = Percent,
    Percent = if_else(
      PoliticalOrientation == "Democrats/leaning independents",
      Percent * -1,
      Percent
    )
  )

g <- dat  %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = Percent,
      y = Population,
      fill = PoliticalOrientation,
      color = PoliticalOrientation,
      label = scales::percent(PercentLabel, scale = 1, accuracy = 1)
    )
  )

g +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(
    data = subset(
      dat, 
      PoliticalOrientation == "Democrats/leaning independents"
    ),
    color = "white",
    hjust = 0
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = subset(
      dat, 
      PoliticalOrientation == "Republicans/leaning independents"
    ),
    color = "white",
    hjust = 1
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#2E74C0", "#CB454A")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#2E74C0", "#CB454A")) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev, position = "right") +
  ggtitle("Who are the unvaccinated?") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    legend.direction = "vertical",
    legend.position = c(1.125, .98),
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0)
  )
```

* Compared to their prevalence in the overall US population, Democrats/leaning independents are **under-represented** among the unvaccinated--and even moreso in October than in April 2021.

* Compared to their prevalence in the overall US population, Republicans/leaning independents are **over-represented** among the unvaccinated as of October, 2021.
